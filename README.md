# Shopping 

Build a shopping list and checkout in React-Native using Redux to store and persist state, React-Navigation to move</br>
between the products list and checkout screen. The code should be written in TypeScript.</br>

The cart will need to keep its state during app loads / refreshes</br>
List Products â€“ these should always be listed to allow adding of products until checkout</br>
Products should be listed in this format: product name, price, button to add product</br>
Must be able to add a product to the cart</br>
Must be able to view number of current products in the cart</br>
Cart products should be listed in this format: product name, price, quantity, total, remove button</br>
Product totals should be tallied to give an overall total</br>
Must be able to remove a product from the cart</br>
Adding an existing product will only update existing cart product quantity (e.g. adding the same product</br>
twice will NOT create two cart items)</br>
All prices should be displayed to 2 decimal places</br>
