between the products list and checkout screen. The code should be written in TypeScript.

List Products â€“ these should always be listed to allow adding of products until checkout
Products should be listed in this format: product name, price, button to add product
Must be able to add a product to the cart
Must be able to view number of current products in the cart
Cart products should be listed in this format: product name, price, quantity, total, remove button
Product totals should be tallied to give an overall total
Must be able to remove a product from the cart
Adding an existing product will only update existing cart product quantity (e.g. adding the same product
twice will NOT create two cart items)
